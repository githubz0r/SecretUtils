# SecretUtils
Some utility functions for analyzing data with Pagoda2/Conos and simulating data with Splatter.

[Example script](https://githubz0r.github.io/SecretUtils/docs/mouse_alzheimer_analysis.html) using subset of data from Keren-Shaul et al https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30578-0 i.e. some mice with alzheimer. Annotation was done based on markers in the paper but coarser (fewer clusters).
A [workflowr][] project.
